# Menv
Bash utility for managing python virtual environmnets. 

## Motivation
While coding in python, I used to have several virtual envs all over the pc with a variety of names so finding a specific virtual env was pain leading to me creating next virtual env and another and yada yada yada. Here is simple code that puts all the virtual envs in one specific dir and lets you list them, check their pip moudles installed, deleting and so on. 

## Usage 
First, you propably need to put this code in .bashrc as a simple function, thats all. 

```
a -l ```
